Digging In is a community-driven, wiki-inspired, deeply interactive WordPress plugin. It allows WordPress administrators and editors to upload and display geographic locations and associate them with information, assessments, and media files (like images, video links, and embedded webpages).

Digging In also allows **any** logged-in user to take assessments about results and upload their own media files for existing points.

Digging In displays its points on a map or street view. It allows users to take virtual tours, perusing others' comments and media files, and uploading their own.

Digging In depends very, very heavily on jQuery and Google Maps. To use most of its map functionality, you'll need to provide a [Google API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key) to the Digging In settings page.
